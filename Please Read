Project Overview

This Unity-based augmented reality (AR) app allows users to visualize furniture in real-world spaces using their iOS devices. The application utilizes Unity’s AR Foundation to detect horizontal planes and place 3D furniture models within the user’s environment.

Features Implemented
	•	Plane Detection: Identifies flat surfaces in the real world to place furniture.
	•	Furniture Selection: Users can select furniture items from a catalog (selection is logged in the console).

Missing / Not Implemented
	•	Object Manipulation: Moving, scaling, and rotating furniture models are not yet implemented.
	•	Android Build: Only an iOS build is available; Android support is not included.
	•	Visual Feedback: Currently, selected furniture models do not appear in the AR view; only console logs are displayed.

Issues / Notes
	•	The project was developed over a span of 2 days, resulting in a basic prototype.
	•	Due to time constraints, several planned features were not implemented.
	•	The iOS build is included in the repository; however, the Android build was not developed.

How to Run
	1.	Open the project in Unity.
	2.	Build and run the project on an iOS device.
	3.	Use the app to detect planes and select furniture items.
	4.	Observe the console for selection logs.
