# AR-Furniture-Placement
An AR-based furniture placement app built using Unity and AR Foundation. Allows users to select furniture from a catalogue and place it in real-world spaces using augmented reality.

The app can:  
- Detect planes in the real world using AR.  
- Place furniture objects on detected planes.  
- Select objects (selection is visible in the console for now).  

What’s missing / not implemented:  
- Moving, scaling, and rotating objects.  
- Android build (only iOS build included).  
- Advanced UI or fancy interactions.  

The project was put together quickly over 2 days, so it’s a basic proof-of-concept rather than a full product.
